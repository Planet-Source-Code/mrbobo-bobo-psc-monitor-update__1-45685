Bobo PSC Monitor Update
This tiny app will inform you of new submissions on PSC and demonstrates how
to implement ownerdrawn menus to add icons and change the font/color of your menus
in the simplest way possible.
Years ago I posted a submission to monitor for new submissions on PSC.  That
submission did much more than check for new postings and as such it broke
one of codings' golden rules - never hardcode addresses/strings. For that app
it was neccessary, but as is inevitable, things changed at PSC and elements 
of that app have become inoperative accordingly. I've simplified this app to
only check for new submissions and the only hard coded address used is one that
is unlikely to change until a complete revamp of PSC occurs.
